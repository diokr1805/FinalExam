                When getting started on this project we had to split up the workload into three. 
                We wanted the workload to be proportionate, which ended up being a challenge. 
                To split the the assignment we decided it was best if everyone picked one thing 
                they would like to do and go from there. Even though the workload turned out 
                somewhat uneven we were all happy to work because we got to choose. Everyone 
                picked one or two html page and styled their own css.

        <div class="items-accessibility">
            <p class="p-accessibility">The challenging aspect of this project was to get a uniform design for all pages, 
                to make it as simple as possible everyone contributed with design ideas which we 
                later adapted to our pages. When styling our pages we utilized a grid layout which 
                would enable us to set up a two dimensional layout. In addition to using grid, 
                we also implemented flexbox layouts to effectively align items and distribute space. 
                To make the pages responsive we decided to use media queries to target various media 
                features with minimum and/or maximum conditions. For example on our page about "P35",
                as the screen gets smaller in width, the layout of the page changes to accommodate as.

                To test our site we went with <i>Lighthouse</i>, 
                an automated tool used to test quality and performance 
                for web apps. We decided to test every page to ensure that
                the score we recieved was consistent throughout the whole site.
                And after a few tweaks the results were almost identical.
                We wanted direct our attention towards the written feedback
                rather than the total score and so we captured some screenshots of the 
                feedback and score.

            <p class="p-accessibility">
                After thoroughly inspecting the accessibility 
                results on all pages, we noticed the SEO score 
                on our introduction page was lower compared to the other pages.
                SEO (search engine optimization) is all about the website being 
                more visible in searches. On our introduction page we had text 
                wrapped in anchor elements to signify where we would place a link, 
                however we decided not to add links. 
                Since search engines use href attributes to crawl on
                websites it creates a conflict when you leave href elements without valid links.

        <div class="items-accessibility">
            <p class="p-accessibility">
                We also noticed the pwa score was nonexistent.
                For <i>Lighthouse</i> to provide a pwa (progressive web app) score
                it has a checklist with various requirements. Some of the minimum requirements
                being a start url property, icons, installability, correct proportions, etc.
