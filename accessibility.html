                <p>When getting started on this project we had to split up the workload into three. 
                    We wanted the workload to be proportionate, which ended up being a challenge. 
                    With our group consisting of three members and the goal being four to five pages 
                    of html and one stylesheet, we decided it was best if everyone picked one thing 
                    they would like to do and go from there. Even though the workload turned out 
                    somewhat uneven we were all happy to work because we got to choose. Everyone 
                    picked one or two html page and styled their own css. 
                </p>

                <p>The challenging aspect of this project was to get a uniform design for all pages, 
                    to make it as simple as possible everyone contributed with design ideas which we 
                    later adapted to our pages. When styling our pages we utilized a grid layout which 
                    would enable us to set up a two dimensional layout. In addition to using grid, 
                    we also implemented flexbox layouts to effectively align items and distribute space. 
                    To make the pages responsive we decided to use media queries to target various media 
                    features with minimum and/or maximum conditions. For example on our page about "P35",
                    as the screen gets smaller in width, the layout of the page changes to accommodate as.
